                What is Lorem Ipsum? <br>
                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <br>
                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, <br>
                when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. <br>
                It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <br>
                It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, <br>
                and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. <br>
