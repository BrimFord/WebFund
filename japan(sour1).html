            <h1>Hoshiume Dried Plums</h1>
            <p>The fragrant Japanese plum (or apricot as it is occasionally called), is associated with spring as they are plum blossom are among the first flowers to bloom in late winter. As the fruit is rather sour, and it is often processed before consumption. While one common form is umeboshi, a pickled plum often paired with white rice, hoshiume are slightly sweeter dried pickled plums. Whatâ€™s more, they are seedless, making them a perfect snackin option. These hoshiume even come in a resealable bag so you can snack on the go.</p>
