We also reserve the right to alter the Goods or Services available for sale on the Website, terminate any Participating Retailers, and/or discontinue any Goods or Services at any time.
<br>
<br>
Total Bill
<br>
5.2 The Total Bill for Delivery, Goods or Services ordered, including delivery charges and other taxes and shopper charges, will be displayed on the Website when you complete your Order at your check out cart.

<br><br>

Mode of Payment
<br>
5.3 Full payment must be made for all Goods dispatched and Services provided. Payment can be made by: (i) online payment via credit or debit card; or (ii) cash-on-delivery.
<br><br>
Price Difference<br>
5.4 Your Total Bill may be varied from the guide price initially displayed on the Website when you placed your Order. This difference of price can be due to one or more of the following reasons:<br>
<ul style=list-style-type:disc;>
<li>Weighed goods &ndash; We cannot guarantee that you will get the exact weight as displayed on the Website when you ordered for your items. You will be paying for the item based on the weight determined upon completion of your order&rsquo;s shopping and dispatching. </li>
<li>Replacements &ndash; When the original item you ordered is unavailable at the Premises, we may instead deliver you a replacement item that you can choose to accept or decline. If you accept the replacement item, you will be charged on its full price instead of the price of your original item. </li>
<li>Changing in-store prices &ndash; The prices at the Participating Retailer&rsquo;s Premise may vary on a daily basis and the final price charged to you is subject to our discretion. Unless otherwise communicated, the price of the item you will be paying will be the price as stated on the Website/ App on the day you ordered. This price is stated in your Order confirmation email. Should price changes be required, we will endeavour to communicate this with you before the completion of your Order. </li>
<li>Technical errors &ndash; Should pricing discrepancies due to technical errors occur, we reserve the right to amend your Order and/or your Total Bill. We will endeavour to communicate with you regarding such price changes before the completion of your Order. </li>
</ul>
5.5 If you are dissatisfied with the pricing differences of your items that resulted from the reasons stated in 5.4, you are entitled to reject the items upon delivery. You will not be charged for any item that you did not accept.
<br><br>
Payment by credit / debit cards<br>

5.6 If you choose online payment, you must provide your payment details before your Order is delivered. To ensure that shopping online is secure, your debit/credit card details will be encrypted to prevent the possibility of someone being able to read them as they are sent over the Internet. Your credit card issuer may also conduct security checks to confirm it is you placing the Order.
<br>

5.7 You agree that for credit card or debit card payments and / or the adding of new cards on your trEAT profile, we will authorize a small sum for card verification purposes. You will not be charged for this amount.
<br>

5.8 You agree that by saving your card details on any of our platforms you are allowing us to make recurring charges to your card. These charges are made without you needing to insert security one time pins (OTP).
<br>
5.9 If you choose to pay by credit card, we will first pre-authorize the amount billed during Checkout. Please note that you are not being charged during this authorization. It simply means that we are sending a request to the issuing bank of your credit card to verify that the credit card is valid and has sufficient funds to cover your Total Bill. Some banks may send a notification regarding this pre-authorization. Upon delivery, (i) if your Total Bill amount is higher than the amount pre-authorized during Checkout, your credit card will be charged a second time via recurring charges for the balance between your Checkout amount and final Total Bill. Some banks may send a notification regarding a second charge. If your credit card transaction is declined for this second charge, we will request for the additional amount in the form of cash on delivery; and (ii) if your final Total Bill is lower than the amount pre-authorized during Checkout, your credit card will be charged for the new Total Bill and the balance will return to your card in accordance with your bank&rsquo;s standard practices; and (iii) if your Total Bill amount is the same as the amount during Checkout, the amount pre-authorized during Checkout will be charged to your credit card. Your bank will update the final charge on your statement accordingly after delivery.
<br>

5.10 If you choose to pay by debit card, your card will be charged at Checkout. Upon delivery, (i) if your Total Bill amount is higher than the amount charged during Checkout, your debit card will be charged a second time via recurring charges for the balance between your Checkout amount and final Total Bill. Some banks may send a notification regarding a second charge. If your debit card transaction is declined for this second charge, we will request for the additional amount in the form of cash on delivery; and (ii) if your final Total Bill amount is lower than the amount paid during Checkout, the balance will be refunded in accordance with your bank&rsquo;s standard practices; and (iii) If your Total Bill amount is the same as the amount during Checkout, no additional charges or refunds will be processed. Your bank will update the final charge on your statement accordingly after delivery.
<br>

5.11 In the event of failed credit or debit card payment, our Total Bill must be made via cash on delivery. Failure to pay with cash on delivery will result in the cancellation of your Order and your items will be returned to the store.
<br>
<br>
Electronic Receipt
<br>
5.12 We do not provide physical receipts for your Order. A digital order confirmation and payment receipt (after payment made) will be emailed to you upon completion of your Order. If you require an official tax invoice, you may reach out to our customer service department.
<br>
<br>
Promotion or discount
<br>
5.13 All discounts and promotions apply to the net total amount (adjusted for Out of Stock Items) but not the gross total. For example: If there is a promotion running for 10% OFF with a minimum purchase price of RM150, Out of stock Items are RM20 then your net total amount would be RM130. Therefore, the promotion of 10% OFF will apply to RM130 and not RM150.
<br>

5.14 By using our services, you agree to be bound by all our promotion terms and conditions that may be published on our Website, App and any other social media platforms and/or various websites and landing pages.
<br>

5.15 Offers are subject to our absolute discretion and may be withdrawn at any time and without notice.
<br>

5.16 The vouchers and/or promo code given are only applicable for current delivery. The vouchers and/or promo code will not be applicable if you choose to cancel it for current delivery. We reserve the right to withdraw or cancel any promo code for any reason at any time. We will not be held liable for any loss arising from the refusal, withdrawal, cancellation or inability to use our promo code.
<br>

5.17 In the event we have a reasonable belief that there exists an abuse of vouchers and/or promo codes or in suspected instances of fraud, trEAT may cause the shopper (or Customer) to be blocked immediately and reserves the right to refuse future service. Additionally, should there exist an abuse of vouchers or discount codes, we reserve the right to seek compensation from any and all violators.
