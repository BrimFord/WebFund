<dt><li>What is trEAT?</li></dt>

<dd>trEAT delivers imported snacks you love to your doorstep in as little as one hour! Our professionally-trained and experienced Personal Shoppers pick the best produce and items while our Drivers deliver them speedily and safely to you.</dd>
<br>

<dt><li>How fast do you deliver?</li></dt>

<dd>Very fast! We can deliver to you in the next 1 or 2 hours. You may also schedule deliveries up to 3 days in advance.</dd>
<br>
<dt><li>How much is the service fee?</li></dt>

<dd>Our service fee varies based on store, delivery distance and time slot that you have selected.
<br>
Some of our stores have extended coverage areas. If the delivery distance from that store to your location is outside of the normal coverage area, an additional charge of RM1 per km will apply.
<br>
Please note that there are no free delivery thresholds for all our stores.
<br>
If you are unsure about the service fee applicable to your order, please make sure to check either via the Delivery Checker page or at Checkout, before confirming your order.</dd>
<br>

<dt><li>What are the delivery hours?</li></dt>

<dd>Our delivery hours are based on the opening hours of the stores we work with. For most stores, we can deliver between 10 am and 9 pm, Monday to Sunday (including Public Holidays).</dd>

<br>
<dt><li>What happens if something is out of stock?</li></dt>

<dd>When something is out of stock at the store, we do our best to replace it with a similar item. After checkout, you can choose to let your shopper pick the replacements themselves, have them call or message you with suggestions or ask that no replacements be provided at all.</dd>
<br>
<dt><li>Are there price differences from the store?</li></dt>

<dd>Where the store is labeled as having &quot;same prices as in-store&quot; on the store selection page, we will endeavor on a best-efforts basis to charge the same price as in-store. However, due to certain circumstances outside of our control (for example, technical issues or sudden price changes in store), there may be small, temporary inconsistencies in our pricing compared with the physical store.
<br>
Where the store is labeled as having prices that &quot;may vary from in-store&quot;, our prices will differ from the in-store price due to a small service charge that we add to the in-store price.
<br>
In either situation above, if you notice an item that you think is priced incorrectly, please reach out to us and we will strive to find a fair solution! We reserve the right to cancel items that are priced incorrectly.</dd>
<br>

<dt><li>How do you treat items that are non-Halal?</li></dt>

<dd>We allow you to buy non-Halal items using trEAT and are very careful to ensure that at no point during checkout, delivery, or at any other time, do Halal and non-Halal items get in contact with each other.</dd>
<br>
<dt><li>How do I check the status of my order?</li></dt>

<dd>You will be notified in real-time when your order is packed, when it is on its way and when it has almost arrived. Remember to turn on your push notifications in your phone settings. You can also go to &quot;My Order Status&quot; to check on the status of your order.</dd>
<br>

Your card may be pre-authorized or charged the total checkout amount when you complete the order confirmation process on our app / website.
Upon delivery:
<br>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">

<dd>If you paid using credit or debit card, your refund will be paid back into your card in accordance with bank&rsquo;s standard practices. Please note each issuer bank will have different time periods to reflect the refunded sum in your bank account/ statement.
If you paid using cash on delivery, your refund will be paid to you in the form of a voucher code, which will be sent to you within 5 working days. This voucher code will entitle you to a discount on your next order.</dd>
<br>
<dt><li>How do I return items?</li></dt>

<br>
<dt><li>What happens to my discount if there are items out of stock?</li></dt>

For example: If you place an order worth RM200 and have a discount code for 20% OFF on your order. However, in cases where your original RM200 has RM60 worth of out of stock items; the 20% discount will apply to the net value of your order i.e. RM140.</dd>
